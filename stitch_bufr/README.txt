This script is designed to extract selected BUFR subsets from one satwndbufr file and combine it with remaining BUFR subsets
from another satwndbufr file, to "stitch" together a new satwndbufr file that contains subsets from both origin satwndbufr
files. This may be done, for example, because when ObsProc generates experimental satwndbufr files observations from subsets
that arrive irregularly (e.g. polar orbiting AMVs) may end up with different ob/counts than the operational satwndbufr file
even if the experiment is intended to change some other satwndbufr subset. This happens because experimental files are
generated by ObsProc on the dev machine and a cron to generate satwndbufr files will sit in the queue for an unknown amount
of time before processing, which may be at a very different time from when ops processed the satwndbufr file even if both
jobs were submitted at the same time (ops from the ops machine, experiment from the dev machine). With some satwnd data coming
and going in-between when these separate jobs run, the counts can end up different.

If, however, you'd like to only take the subsets of interest in the experiment satwndbufr file and use ops data for the rest
of the satwndbufr file, you can do that here.

NOTES:

1) Iliana suggests that we use the following modules:

module load bufr/11.7.0

This is done to make sure that the splitting executable is run as split_by_subset.x <satwndbufr>, rather than legacy versions
that require an enter-key stroke between running and setting the name of the file to be split.

2) We can follow the logic used in this GitHub commit to GSI:

To define the procedure for stitching a satwndbufr file. See scripts/exglobal_atmos_analysis.sh changes:

> SPLITBUFREXEC=${SPLITBUFREXEC:-$HOMEgfs/exec/splitbufr.x}
> $SPLITBUFREXEC $SATWND
> rm NC00502*
> cat NC005044 NC005045 NC005046 NC005064 NC005065 NC005066 NC005070 NC005071 NC005080 NC005091 NC005030 NC005031 NC005034 NC005039 NC005072 > ./satwndbufr

This will remove all NC00502* subsets (India INSAT AMVs) and concencate the other specified subsets into satwndbufr. We can use
a similar procedure for our stitching.
